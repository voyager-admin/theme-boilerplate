# Voyager theme boilerplate
This repository serves as a starting point to develop a custom theme plugin for Voyager 2.


To create your own style, fork this repository then run `composer install` and `npm install`.  
After that, make your changes to the variables found in [resources/src/styles.scss](./resources/src/styles.scss) and compile by running  
`npm run prod` 


## TODO
The Voyager version in composer.json needs to be ported to use `voyager-admin`
